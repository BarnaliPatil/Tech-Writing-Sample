In **process** control application, sensors are used to measure physical variables such as Level, Temperature, Flow, Pressure, Speed, and Position. Temperature indicators are process control installation instruments that can process signals from temperature sensors and show them on the display. The TI 7750 is an advanced __microcontroller__ based single channel Process / Temperature Indicator used for monitoring analog signals in the majority of industrial processes.  It can accept mA, mV, Volts, PT100 RTDs and Thermocouple input signals.


Basic *input* types are selected by on card jumpers and by selecting from the keyboard.Optional single or dual _alarm_ output is provided, alarm type and value are programmable from the front panel keyboard. Alarm condition on Sensor break, Over range or Under range is programmable individually for each alarm.

***Programmable Power*** On alarm delay timer is provided to inhibit alarm operation for the duration of the delay time.
All programmed values are ___stored permanently___ in non-volatile memory. Its __*intelligent*__ program lock facility **_prevents_** the set parameters from being tampered.
